<p><strong> This is the very first project starting out in Web Development at Indian Railway with an approach of implementation while learning, which may have led to poor management and functioning of the code. However, the sole purpose we were trying to achieve was the implementation of the flowchart above in the code. Working on version 2 with better approach. </strong> </p>

<p><strong>WORKING:</strong> After logged in you can find - </p>
<p>There is a <strong>USER</strong> section where the admin can add or remove users. A new user can register only as a general user and gets only viewing option; to become an admin, he or she must contact the current admin.</p>
<p>In the <strong>COACH MANAGEMENT</strong> section, the admin can add a new coach, which has recently been introduced or built.</p>
<p>In the <strong>REGISTRATION</strong> section, a coach is registered for repair or maintenance in the workshop. Only after that is it sent to the maintenance area.</p>
<p>The <strong>MAINTENANCE</strong> section has many tables, each representing a specific shop in the workshop. A coach travels through all these shops for repair or maintenance, as shown in the flow chart above. Here, the location of the coaches can easily be seen, i.e., in which shop it is currently located. The admin can move the coaches from one shop to another by selecting a particular coach and pressing the arrow button.</p>
<p>Finally, in the <strong>REPORT</strong> section, all the details and history of a specific coach (including the ones present in the shop) can be seen.</p>
